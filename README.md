# Challenge solution


### My solution for the ThoughtfulAutomation RPA Challenge
[See challenge description here.](Challenge_Description.md)

### Setup
Modify **config/config.yaml** for basic configuration:
- agency: to select the agency whose "Individual Investments" are going to be scraped. 
- pdf_path: the path where PDF files are going to be downloaded.

To initiate the scraper by running: 
```bash
rcc run
```
RCC from Robocorp should be installed. 
You can install RCC following the instructions in Robocorps Documentation.
